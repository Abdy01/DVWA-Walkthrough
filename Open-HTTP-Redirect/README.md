# Open HTTP Redirect

## About
> OWASP define this as:
>
> Unvalidated redirects and forwards are possible when a web application accepts untrusted input that could cause the web application to redirect the request to a URL contained within untrusted input. By modifying untrusted URL input to a malicious site, an attacker may successfully launch a phishing scam and steal user credentials. 
> 
> As suggested above, a common use for this is to create a URL which initially goes to the real site but then redirects the victim off to a site controlled by the attacker. This site could be a clone of the target's login page to steal credentials, a request for credit card details to pay for a service on the target site, or simply a spam page full of advertising.
