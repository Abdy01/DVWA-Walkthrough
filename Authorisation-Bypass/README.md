# Authorisation Bypass

## About
> When developers have to build authorisation matrices into complex systems it is easy for them to miss adding the right checks in every place, especially those which are not directly accessible through a browser, for example API calls.
> 
> As a tester, you need to be looking at every call a system makes and then testing it using every level of user to ensure that the checks are being carried out correctly. This can often be a long and boring task, especially with a large matrix with lots of different user types, but it is critical that the testing is carried out as one missed check could lead to an attacker gaining access to confidential data or functions.
